const is strictly limited to block-scope where var can be global
Var can be both resassigned and redeclared, const cannot be redeclared OR resassigned (in the scope of its own block)

- What is hoisting?
Only relevant to var, hoisting is when var variables are declared first during compilation, and then initialized after.
This results in issues where if you were to try to console.log() a var before it was initialized, the console will return undefined.
